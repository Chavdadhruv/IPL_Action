# IPL_Action
Project Title: IPL_Action

Description:

IPL_Action is an engaging simulation of an IPL-style auction built using Python, leveraging the capabilities of matplotlib for visualization and pandas for data handling. This project enables users to simulate a player auction where teams, represented by various IPL franchises, bid for players based on predefined budgets and player base prices.

Key Features:
Team and Player Management: The application includes modules to create, save, and load team details and player information, stored in .txt files. Each team is assigned a budget, and a list of players with base prices is generated randomly.
Auction Simulation: Teams compete for players in a simulated auction environment. Each team has a budget, and bidding is handled automatically based on availability of funds, allowing the auction to feel realistic.
Visualization: The project visualizes team finances and player acquisition costs:
Bar and Pie Charts: These charts represent the teamsâ€™ budgets before the auction, allowing easy comparison.
Individual Player Purchase Charts: This feature displays player costs per team, visualizing expenditure distribution.
Highlighting Maximum Budget Team: Teams with the highest budget are highlighted for easy identification.
Technical Stack:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used: matplotlib for visualizations, pandas (optional) for data handling.
